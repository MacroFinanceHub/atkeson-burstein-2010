### atkeson-burstein-2010

A repository with code that will replicate Atkeson and Bustein's 2010 JPE paper on "[Innovation, Firm dynamics, and International Trade](http://www.econ.ucla.edu/arielb/innovation.pdf)". This not my code, it's from Ariel's website. But I modified it so I could understand stuff in the paper.

- [notes.md](notes.md) describes the paper, my take, and commands to execute to illustrate some of the main points in the paper.
